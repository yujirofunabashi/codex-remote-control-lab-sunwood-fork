# Codex Remote Control Lab

Codex Remote Control Lab turns your phone into a remote control for the Codex session running on your desktop. Start the bridge on the Mac, open the tokenized URL from a phone, and continue the same Codex thread from either device.

It is a local-first experiment for OpenAI Codex CLI `remote-control` and `app-server` workflows. It keeps the Codex app-server on `127.0.0.1`, then exposes only a small token-protected browser bridge to devices on the same LAN.

## ✨ What It Does

- starts a repository-local Codex CLI `0.130.0` app-server
- lets a phone browser operate the desktop Codex app-server without exposing that app-server directly to the LAN
- syncs one active Codex thread between desktop and phone, so you can start on the PC, step away, and keep working from mobile
- serves a phone-friendly browser UI with thread resume, artifact preview, approvals, model selection, image attachments, and selectable color themes
- shares one bridge-managed Codex thread across a phone and desktop browser
- keeps `.phone-token`, `.uploads/`, `.codex-home*/`, logs, and session databases out of Git
- publishes bilingual docs through VitePress and GitHub Pages

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/codex-remote-control-lab.git
cd codex-remote-control-lab
npm ci
npm run phone
```

To run the same browser bridge UI against Claude Code instead of Codex, use the experimental provider:

```bash
npm run phone:claude
```

The command prints a URL like this:

```text
http://192.168.11.8:45214/?token=...
```

Open that exact URL from a phone connected to the same Wi-Fi/LAN.

For repeatable local settings, copy the example file and edit it:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

For localhost-only UI debugging without a token, run:

```bash
PHONE_DEBUG_NO_TOKEN=1 npm run phone
```

You can also put `PHONE_DEBUG_NO_TOKEN=1` in `.env` for the same localhost-only mode.

That debug mode binds the bridge to `127.0.0.1` and prints a URL without `?token=...`. Do not use it for LAN, tunnel, or shared-network access.

If you intentionally need tokenless access from another device on a trusted LAN, add `PHONE_DEBUG_BIND=lan` alongside `PHONE_DEBUG_NO_TOKEN=1`. This binds the bridge to `0.0.0.0` and prints LAN URLs without a token, so only use it on a private network you control.

## 🧭 Architecture

```text
phone browser -> http://Mac-LAN-IP:45214 -> Node bridge -> ws://127.0.0.1:45213 -> Codex app-server
```

The safer boundary is intentional: Codex's app-server remains bound to localhost; only the small token-protected bridge is reachable from the LAN.

## 🧪 Verification Commands

```bash
npm run check
npm run docs:build
npm audit --omit=dev
```

Protocol-only smoke test:

```bash
npm run server:ws
npm run probe:ws
```

The local smoke test verified `initialize` and `thread/start` through the WebSocket app-server, plus `/readyz` and `/healthz` behavior.

## 📱 Phone Bridge

The main value of the bridge is continuity: the desktop keeps running Codex locally, while the phone becomes a LAN remote for that same session. The bridge-managed thread can be opened from both the PC browser and the phone browser, making the workflow feel synced instead of split across devices.

Useful environment variables:

```text
PHONE_UI_PORT=45214
CODEX_WORKDIR=/Users/admin/Prj/some-project
CODEX_MODEL=gpt-5.4
PHONE_AGENT_PROVIDER=codex
CLAUDE_WORKDIR=/Users/admin/Prj/some-project
CLAUDE_MODEL=sonnet
CODEX_APP_SERVER_SOCK=/Users/admin/.codex/app-server-control/app-server-control.sock
CODEX_APP_SERVER_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:45213
CODEX_HISTORY_SYNC=1
PHONE_CODEX_RATE_LIMIT_REFRESH_COMMAND="node scripts/read-desktop-rate-limits.js"
PHONE_TOKEN=choose-your-own-token
PHONE_DEBUG_NO_TOKEN=1
PHONE_DEBUG_BIND=lan
PHONE_NTFY_TOPIC=your-private-topic
PHONE_PUSHOVER_TOKEN=app-token
PHONE_PUSHOVER_USER=user-key
PHONE_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...
PHONE_NOTIFY_TIMEOUT_MS=5000
```

See [.env.example](.env.example) for a public-safe template.

`CODEX_APP_SERVER_SOCK` or `CODEX_APP_SERVER_URL` makes the bridge attach to an existing headless app-server instead of starting a new one. For live sync with Codex Desktop, use this with a Desktop Remote Connection that points at the same headless app-server. The normal local conversation view in Codex Desktop uses a private `stdio` app-server, so there is no public external route for a bridge to inject live UI updates into that local view.

History sync is enabled by default. After a web turn completes, the bridge warms the app-server history with `thread/read` and a scan-backed `thread/list`, and `/api/threads` also avoids state-DB-only listing. This helps Codex Desktop discover the updated session after reopening or refreshing the thread. It does not inject live updates into an already-open normal Desktop conversation view. Set `CODEX_HISTORY_SYNC=0` to disable the extra history refresh calls.

`npm run phone:claude` sets `PHONE_AGENT_PROVIDER=claude`, holds one `claude -p --input-format stream-json --output-format stream-json` process open per bridge, and reads same-workdir Claude Code JSONL sessions for the sidebar. Turns stream into the running process, so a follow-up skips session startup; changing the model or access mode retires the process and starts a fresh one.

Approvals reach the same UI as Codex. Claude Code spawns a stdio MCP server (`scripts/claude-approval-mcp.js`) that dials back to the bridge over a per-bridge Unix socket, so no port is bound and concurrent bridges or concurrent phone servers cannot collide. The transport fails closed: an unreachable socket, a timeout (`PHONE_APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_MS`, default 5 minutes), or a bridge with no browser attached all deny. Picking フルアクセス runs at `bypassPermissions` and skips the prompt entirely.

Codex-only app-server plugin lookup and history sync stay disabled in Claude mode.

Codex rate-limit display is optional. Set `PHONE_CODEX_RATE_LIMIT_REFRESH_COMMAND="node scripts/read-desktop-rate-limits.js"` to read local Codex auth, call the usage endpoint, normalize remaining percentage/reset metadata, and cache only the display snapshot in `.phone-rate-limits.json`.

Notifications are opt-in. `PHONE_NTFY_TOPIC` sends bridge events to an ntfy topic, `PHONE_PUSHOVER_TOKEN` plus `PHONE_PUSHOVER_USER` sends them through Pushover, and `PHONE_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` posts them to Discord. Startup notifications include the ready URLs, and task notifications fire on completion, failure, and approval requests. `npm run phone` loads local `.env` values before reading these variables. `PHONE_NTFY_SERVER` defaults to `https://ntfy.sh` and must use HTTPS. Notification bodies can include tokenized bridge URLs, so use a private/protected topic, account, or channel and keep these values in local environment variables.

Tokenless debug mode intentionally skips startup notifications. If you manually send a `PHONE_DEBUG_NO_TOKEN=1` plus `PHONE_DEBUG_BIND=lan` URL to Discord, treat that channel as private and trusted: anyone who can open the URL on the LAN can operate the bridge without a token.

The current phone bridge supports:

- Codex Desktop-like browser layout with a left thread sidebar, central conversation, right artifact panel, and bottom composer
- recent thread listing and direct thread resume
- default history-sync refresh for Desktop reopen/refresh continuity
- experimental Claude provider mode through `npm run phone:claude`
- optional Codex rate-limit status display through a local refresh command
- mobile slash command completion for installed skills
- mobile-safe artifact card opening from chat and review digest cards
- plugin, model, config/auth, and automation status panels
- run-state interrupt, reconnect, completion, failure, and approval indicators
- approval and sandbox mode controls for the next turn
- Markdown rendering in chat and artifact previews
- Markdown image links rendered inline where possible
- browser-selected image attachments sent as Codex `localImage` inputs
- local repository image artifacts served through token-protected file routes
- collapsed status/tool logs with expandable detail rows
- simple, cyberpunk, botanical, and Stigmata color themes saved in browser local storage

## 🔐 Safety Notes

- Keep the Codex app-server on `127.0.0.1`.
- Do not bind an unauthenticated Codex app-server to a LAN or public interface.
- Treat the printed `?token=...` URL like a local access key. Do not post it in public issues, chats, screenshots, or streams.
- Use `PHONE_DEBUG_NO_TOKEN=1` for localhost debugging. Add `PHONE_DEBUG_BIND=lan` only when you intentionally want tokenless LAN access on a trusted private network.
- Stop the bridge with `Ctrl+C`. If you close the terminal or restart the PC, run `npm run phone` again.
- Use SSH forwarding, a VPN, or a mesh network for access outside a trusted LAN.
- Do not expose the bridge through an unauthenticated public tunnel or raw port forward.
- Delete `.phone-token` or set a new `PHONE_TOKEN` after demos on shared networks.
