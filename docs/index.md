## Quick Start

```bash
npm ci
npm run phone
```

Open the printed URL from a phone or another browser on the same Wi-Fi/LAN. The phone can drive the desktop Codex session, and another browser can resume the same bridge-managed thread.

For protocol-only testing, run the app-server and probe from separate terminals:

```bash
npm run server:ws
npm run probe:ws
```

## Layout

```text
phone browser -> http://Mac-LAN-IP:45214 -> Node bridge -> ws://127.0.0.1:45213 -> Codex app-server
```

The app-server remains local. The bridge requires a token on page, API, and WebSocket requests by default. For host-only UI debugging, `PHONE_DEBUG_NO_TOKEN=1 npm run phone` binds the bridge to `127.0.0.1` and omits the token. For intentional tokenless LAN debugging on a trusted private network, add `PHONE_DEBUG_BIND=lan`.
